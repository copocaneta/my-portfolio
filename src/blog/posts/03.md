Effective engineering management is a journey, and along the way, I’ve found inspiration and guidance from thought leaders like Jocko Willink and Sarah Drasner. Their insights have shaped my approach to leadership and team building, and this blog post is a reflection of the principles and lessons I’ve learned.

## Inspirations in Leadership and Management

### Jocko Willink: The Discipline of Leadership
Jocko Willink, a retired Navy SEAL officer and author of *Leadership Strategy and Tactics: Field Manual*, has been a profound influence on my leadership philosophy. I first came across Jocko through his podcast, *Jocko Podcast*, where his disciplined approach to leadership and his status as a jiu-jitsu black belt resonated deeply with me. His emphasis on "Extreme Ownership" taught me that accountability and trust are the cornerstones of effective leadership. A few months after the book’s release, I purchsed it and was captivated by its practical strategies for leading teams under pressure.

### Sarah Drasner: Empathy and Clarity in Engineering Management
I discovered Sarah Drasner’s work through her appearance on the *Syntax Podcast* (Episode 273, "Engineering Management" aired on February 24, 2021: [link](https://syntax.fm/show/273)). Her insights into the human side of engineering management inspired me to buy her book, *Engineering Management for the Rest of Us*, imediately after listening to the episode. Drasner’s approach emphasizes the importance of empathy, structured communication, and creating a safe environment for teams to thrive. Her pratical advice has been instrumental in helping me navigate the challenges of scaling and supporting engineering teams.

## Leadership Fundamentals

Effective engineering management combines technical expertise with strong people skills. As Jocko Willink says, "Leadership is about relationships, and relationships are about trust." Building trust within a team requires transparency, consistency, and a willingness to take responsibility for outcomes.

Sarah Drasner builds on this by highlighting the role of empathy in leadership. She argues that understanding the individual needs of team members and providing clear, actionable feedback are critical for fostering a positive team culture.

## Key Areas of Focus

1. **Team Communication**
   Communication is the backbone of any successful team. Jocko emphasizes the need for clarity and alignment in all interactions. Drasner, on the other hand, advocates for a blend of synchronous and asynchronous communication strategies to cater to diverse team setups. For example:
   - Optimize daily standups to focus on blockers and priorities, keeping them concise and engaging.
   - Foster a culture of documentation to reduce dependency on verbal communication and support asynchronous work.
   - Encourage regular cross-team syncs to build alignment and break silos.

2. **Technical Decision Making**
   - **Architecture Reviews**: Establish a structured process for architecture reviews to ensure alignment and avoid technical debt.
   - **Technology Selection**: Use frameworks like the one Drasner recommends to evaluate the long-term implications of adopting new tools.
   - **Innovation and Risk Management**: Dedicate time for hackathons and proof-of-concept projects while carefully assessing risks.

## Essential Skills for Managers

### People Management
- One-on-ones are vital for building trust and addressing concerns.
- Performance reviews should tie feedback to outcomes and individual growth plans.
- Conflict resolution requires empathy and fairness, as Drasner emphasizes in her book.

### Project Management
Effective engineering management requires adapting Agile methodologies to fit the team’s needs, balancing resource allocation, and ensuring clear communication with stakeholders.

### Technical Leadership
- Promote a constructive code review culture.
- Provide mentorship opportunities for junior developers.
- Encourage knowledge sharing through dedicated sessions.

## Scaling and Growth Strategies

### Team Scaling
Scaling a team involves more than just hiring. It’s about creating a structure that supports growth while maintaining the team’s culture and values. Drasner’s advice on onboarding programs has been particularly helpful, ensuring that new hires feel integrated and productive quickly.

### Process Improvement
Continuous improvement is essential. From workflow optimization to automation and quality assurance, engineering managers should constantly seek ways to enhance team efficiency and output.

## Conclusion

The journey of engineering management is one of constant learning and adaptation. By drawing on the wisdom of leaders like Jocko Willink and Sarah Drasner, managers can build empowered, resilient teams that are ready to tackle challenges and drive success. As Willink reminds us, "Leaders must own everything in their world," and that ownership extends to supporting and growing the people who make our teams exceptional.
